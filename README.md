System-Identification-of-Aircraft's-Pure-Rolling-Motion

# Abstract
This project deals with the system identification of aircraft's pure rolling motion dynamics. A scaled model of the aircraft is kept in a wind-tunnel to collect roll-angle and roll-rate measurement. The first order model is parameterized as G(s) = k/(s+a) and unknown parameters (gain k and pole a) are determined using least-square estimation. The identified model is used to validate the collected experimental data. The accompanying handwritten note provides additional details.
